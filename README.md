# 👨‍💻 Akshay Joshi – CTO & Co-Founder, DoozieSoft

Hi, I’m Akshay — a backend-heavy generalist and systems thinker based in Bangalore, India.  
I’ve been building enterprise software for over a decade, currently driving the AI-native pivot of [DoozieSoft](https://www.dooziesoft.com), the company I co-founded in 2013.
